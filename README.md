# Mall Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project was completed as part of my internship at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The objective of this task was to apply the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history using the **Mall Customer Dataset**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer segmentation helps businesses understand their customers better by dividing them into groups with similar purchasing behavior.  
In this project, I used the **K-Means clustering algorithm** to segment customers based on features like:

- Age  
- Annual Income  
- Spending Score

## 📊 Dataset

- **Dataset Used:** [Mall Customer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial)  
- The dataset contains details of 200 mall customers including:
  - Customer ID  
  - Gender  
  - Age  
  - Annual Income  
  - Spending Score

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Google Colab** (for running the notebook online)  
- **Python Libraries:**  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - matplotlib  
  - seaborn  
  - scikit-learn

## ⚙️ Steps Performed

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded the dataset into Colab
   - Checked for missing values
   - Selected Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score for clustering

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized data distributions
   - Explored relationships among features

3. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Applied the Elbow Method to find optimal clusters
   - Ran K-Means and assigned cluster labels

4. **Visualization**
   - Scatter plots to visualize clusters
   - Segmented groups clearly displayed

## 📈 Results

- Customers were divided into **n number of clear segments** based on their purchasing behavior.
